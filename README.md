# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript introduces types in JS, JS provides us with 3 primitive data types which are `Number`, `String` and `Boolean`.

## Why TypeScript

TypeScript unlike JS likes to throw error, whenever you're not declarative and clear with the types of variables or properties. Now some of you may be wondering that if the language throw so many errors why people use it and love it, well if you've programmed with JS enough you may have come accross some errors where you forgot to check the type of a variable or maybe your code seemed correct but it doesn't work as intended as you forgot to check if the input is a string or a number.  
TypeScript fills that gap, it throws errors which helps you improve your program, so that your program doesn't break.
